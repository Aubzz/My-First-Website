            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A refreshing Japanese summertime treat! My favorite way to serve it is with frozen whipped cream and chocolate sauce, although it's also delicious with ice cream, regular whipped cream, or flavored coffee cream! It can be served solid in glasses, or cubed in bowls.</p>
            <p>It is lively and chewy, and also gives a bitter but a sweet taste at the same time. Some describe it as creamy, but others say it has a fluffy texture to it. It really just depends on the individual. The mixture of coffee and sugar creates a tasty combination of milky and sweet but also lovely bitter at the same tim</p>
